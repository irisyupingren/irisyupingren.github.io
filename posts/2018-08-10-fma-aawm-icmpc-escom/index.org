I had a very good experience with all four conferences. This is my third time to FMA, but the rest are all new to me. There were a variety of audience, talks and posters. Itâ€™s amazing how people from different fields come together and talk about a diverse range of topics related to music.

What is the most valuable is the intellectual stimulation from seeing new research results, discussing how we have been doing research (on different and similar topics), connecting with a larger community, reflecting and planning on my own research, etc.

A big thank you to all the old friends and new friends, it was very nice seeing you there. Next time is ISMIR in September. See you in Paris ðŸ™‚
